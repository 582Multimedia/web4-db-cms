# Git workflow

Sign in VSCode with github account

Install git (if not installed already, macs will already have it)

Open a new terminal inside VSCode

Check if git is here:

```bash
git -v
```

Add user name and email credentials for git to work

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

```bash
git config --global user.email "12345678@edu.vaniercollege.qc.ca"
```

First class only, or whenever you want to add and upload a new repo:

Commit and Publish to github, you will have the choice of public or private repo and push.

**_MAKE SURE THERE IS A COMMIT MESSAGE BEFORE COMMITING EVERY SINGLE TIME_**

Having a message is the most critical part.
