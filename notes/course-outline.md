# Course Outline

## Course’s role in the program

Web 4: Databases & Content Management Systems is a deeper dive into CMS and databases. In addition to creating and managing content for a CMS, students will manage the system. Students will explore database design, programming user-centered, interactive applications. They will draw on production skills learned in other courses. This course flows into Web 5: Web Applications where students will use what they have learned to work with clients and create a web portfolio. Similarly, other courses this semester will be dipping into the same waters of user-centered design.

## Course objectives & learning activities

Students will demonstrate basic competency with dataabases well as:
• Manage content management systems.
• Produce and manage user-centered content.
• Integrate databases into dynamic web applications.
• Implement effective user flows that support intuitive navigation.

Students will develop their learning through a combination of:
• in-class lectures and demonstrations
• online readings, tutorials, and videos
• individual and collaborative exercises designed to help students learn the components necessary to master competencies
• individual and group projects designed to challenge and evaluate students learning outcomes

Students will be assessed using a combination of, but not limited to, the following:
• individual and collaborative exercises
• create a web app using a public API
• backup and restore or migrate a CMS
